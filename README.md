## 1. Love，by Roy Croft
I love you,
<p>Not only for what you are,
<p>But for what I am
<p>When I am with you.
<p>I love you,
<p>Not only for what
<p>You have made of yourself,
<p>But for what
<p>You are making of me.
<p>I love you
<p>For the part of me
<p>That you bring out;
<p>I love you
<p>For putting your hand
<p>Into my heaped-up heart
<p>And passing over
<p>All the foolish, weak things
<p>That you can’t help
<p>Dimly seeing there,
<p>And for drawing out
<p>Into the light
<p>All the beautiful belongings
<p>That no one else had looked
<p>Quite far enough to find.
<p>I love you because you
<p>Are helping me to make
<p>Of the lumber of my life
<p>Not a tavern
<p>But a temple;
<p>Out of the works
<p>Of my every day
<p>Not a reproach
<p>But a song.
<p>I love you
<p>Because you have done
<p>More than any creed
<p>Could have done
<p>To make me good
<p>And more than any fate
<p>Could have done
<p>To make me happy.
<p>You have done it
<p>Without a touch,
<p>Without a word,
<p>Without a sign.
<p>You have done it
<p>By being yourself.
<p>Perhaps that is what
<p>Being a friend means,
<p>After all.
